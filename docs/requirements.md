# Requirements

Foam tries to impose as few requirements as possible, but some constraints are necessary to build interoperable tools.

- Documents must be written in markdown (or a markdown superset like MDX, or an as-yet-unspecified hypothetical Foam format).
- Documents must start with Level 1 `# Heading`, and the content of the heading is the title of the page.
