# Creating a New Language

## Creating a new language

What if we created a new language that made it more ergonomic to use VS Code as a Foam workspace

- Based on markdown
- Could leverage mdx?
- Shortcuts, like links between pages
- Downside: Not markdown compatible, not so good for other tools
  - Could it be a markdown superset?
  - Or a language that transpiles to markdown and back, so it can be edited in "Foam" format and committed in MD so it's viewable on GH as markdown
    - How imporant is it that links are navigable on GH? I guess it is
